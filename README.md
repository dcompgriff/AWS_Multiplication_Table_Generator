==========================

-Code Purpose:
This website generates an nx10 multiplication table in 10 item sections, up to 500x10 (Can be increased, but I thought that 500 was enough). 

-Code Used:
This website was built using Node.js, Express middleware for node, html, css3, and jquery. Some themes were also used from bootstrap to make the site look a bit nicer (although in an industry application, bootstrap shouldn't be imported simply for its css styles).
